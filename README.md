# Code Challenge
This repository contains three toy problem challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator. Each challenge focuses on a specific task and provides a solution in JavaScript.

 ## Challenges
 ### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This challenge prompts the user to input student marks, which should be between 0 and 100. It then outputs the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

- A: Marks greater than 79
- B: Marks between 60 and 79
- C: Marks between 59 and 49
- D: Marks between 40 and 49
- E: Marks less than 40
 ### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
In this challenge, the program takes the input of a car's speed and checks if it is above or below the speed limit of 70 km/h. If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, it assigns one demerit point to the driver and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

 ### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
The task of this challenge is to calculate an individual's net salary based on the input of their basic salary and benefits. The program calculates various deductions such as payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, as well as the gross salary and net salary.

## Project Setup
To run the solutions for these challenges, make sure you have a JavaScript environment or a browser console available. You can copy the code provided for each challenge and run it in your preferred JavaScript environment.
